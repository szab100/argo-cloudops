# Quickstart

>You can now simply open, build and run this project by clicking the button below.<br>Everything is preinstalled for you, so you can ignore the following sections and just run `./scripts/start_local.sh`.

Note: this is a quick guide for getting something up and running. This is configured for local setups and not meant to be run in production

## Pre-reqs

*The quickstart currently only supports macOS.*

* Clone the Argo CloudOps GitHub [repository](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argo-cloudops).

* Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), ensure [Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/) is running.

* Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

* Install **Argo CLI** `brew install argo`

* Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for json parsing.

## Deploy Sample App Locally

You will need two windows

1. Vault & Argo CloudOps Service
1. Client commands, etc


### Start Vault & Argo CloudOps Service

* In window **#1**, ensure you have [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) for the target account configured and access to your kubernetes cluster. For the AWS credentials, export the AWS_PROFILE that is to be used.

* Set **ARGO_CLOUDOPS_ADMIN_SECRET** env var to `abcd1234abcd1234`.

    ```sh
    export ARGO_CLOUDOPS_ADMIN_SECRET=abcd1234abcd1234
    ```

* Start the Argo CloudOps Service (includes workflows, vault, and postgres).
  Note: this will copy your current AWS credentials to the vault containers.

    ```sh
    bash scripts/quickstart_run.sh
    ```

### Create Argo CloudOps Project And Target (One Time Setup)

* In window **#2**, ensure you have the **ARGO_CLOUDOPS_ADMIN_SECRET**
env var set to `abcd1234abcd1234`.

    ```sh
    export ARGO_CLOUDOPS_ADMIN_SECRET=abcd1234abcd1234
    ```

* Ensure your AWS credentials are set for the **target account** and create
  your first project and target. The output contains an export command for the **ARGO_CLOUDOPS_USER_TOKEN**
  for the new project.

    ```sh
    bash scripts/create_project.sh https://github.com/argoproj-labs/argo-cloudops.git
    ```

### Run Workflow

* In window **#2**, ensure the **ARGO_CLOUDOPS_USER_TOKEN** for the project is
  specified (the output of `create_project.sh` should have output a bash
  command to export it).

* CDK Example

    ```sh
    # CDK Example
    CDK_WORKFLOW_NAME=`bash scripts/run_gitops_example.sh manifests/kube_cdk_manifest.yaml 5b40793bded1030d8a17d6ddd050ee1ef060f8cc`

    # Get the status/follow the logs
    ./quickstart/argo-cloudops get $CDK_WORKFLOW_NAME
    ./quickstart/argo-cloudops logs -f $CDK_WORKFLOW_NAME
    ```

* TERRAFORM Example

    ```sh
    # Terraform Example
    TERRAFORM_WORKFLOW_NAME=`bash scripts/run_gitops_example.sh manifests/kube_terraform_manifest.yaml 5b40793bded1030d8a17d6ddd050ee1ef060f8cc`

    # Get the status/follow the logs
    ./quickstart/argo-cloudops get $TERRAFORM_WORKFLOW_NAME
    ./quickstart/argo-cloudops logs -f $TERRAFORM_WORKFLOW_NAME
    ```
